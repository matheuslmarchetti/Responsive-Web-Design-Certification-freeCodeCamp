            <h2>Here's a time line of Slash's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1965</strong> - Born in Hampstead, London.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1979</strong> - Slash decided to form a band with his friend Steven Adler. The band never materialized, but it prompted Slash to take up an instrument. Since Adler had designated himself the role of guitarist, Slash decided to learn how to play bass. During his first lesson, Slash decided to switch from bass to guitar after hearing Robert Wolin, a teacher at Fairfax Music School, play "Brown Sugar" by the Rolling Stones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1981 - 1985</strong> - Slash joined his first band, Tidus Sloan, in 1981. In 1983, he formed the band Road Crew named after the Motörhead song "(We Are) The Road Crew" with his childhood friend Steven Adler, who by then had learned to play drums. He placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what became the Guns N' Roses song "Rocket Queen".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1985 - 1986</strong> - Slash was asked by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin to join their new band Guns N' Roses, along withDuff McKagan and Steven Adler (replacing founding members Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner, respectively). They played Los Angeles area nightclubs such as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadour and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. Before one of the shows in 1985, Slash shoplifted a black felt top hat and a Native American-style silver concho belt from two stores on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. He then combined the hat with parts of the belt to create a piece of custom headwear for the show. He said he "felt really cool" wearing the hat, and it became his trademark. It was during 1985 and 1986 that the band wrote most of its classic material, including "Welcome to the Jungle", "Sweet Child o' Mine" and "Paradise City".
